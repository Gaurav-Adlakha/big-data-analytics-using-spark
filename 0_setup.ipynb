    "The purpose of this part is to ensure you have a working and compatible Python and PySpark installation. In order to avoid potential compatibility issues generated from students using different versions than the expected, we provide a Docker image with Ubuntu 16.04 and a clean Anaconda 4.3 with python 3.6, jupyter 5.4, spark 2.2 installation. We also provide a script to run the docker image and get Jupyter running on it so that you can program on it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Docker containers are not intended to store data. We highly recommend you develop your solutions locally and only use docker to compile and run. The following guides show you how to do that. Obtained results should be stored locally as well. If you develop within the container you are at risk of losing your work. You have been warned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you work within the provided container (interactively or not) you are automatically logged in as a user named ucsddse230. Your homework notebook is mounted in the directory /home/ucsddse230/work. If you delete the mounted directory containing your work it will be deleted from the host system. Make sure your work is secure at all times. We recommend you use some sort of version control such as git.\n",
